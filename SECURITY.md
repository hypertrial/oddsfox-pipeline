## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Report security issues through **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**:
open the repository on GitHub, go to **Security** → **Report a vulnerability**,
and submit a private report.

Include:

- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept if available)
- Affected versions or commits
- Suggested fix or mitigation, if you have one

We will acknowledge receipt and work with you on a timeline for investigation and disclosure.

## Scope notes

OddsFox is a **local-first** prediction-market data pipeline. The current
implementation reads public Polymarket/Gamma and CLOB APIs and stores data in a
local DuckDB warehouse. Optional CLOB credentials in `.env` are user-supplied
and must never be committed to the repository.
