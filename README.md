OddsFox is an open-source, local-first data pipeline for prediction-market
data.

It uses Dagster to orchestrate dlt ingestion, DuckDB storage, Python sync
ledgers, and dbt analytics models. Version `0.1.x` starts with FIFA World Cup
2026 Polymarket markets and odds, but the project direction is broader:
inspectable prediction-market pipelines that run locally first.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
cp .env.example .env
uv run make dbt-parse
uv run make dagster-dev
```

Schedules are disabled by default. Keep them off until manual jobs and dbt
builds are healthy.

Read the full [Getting Started guide](docs/quickstart.md).

## Architecture

OddsFox keeps the data stack local and inspectable:

- Prediction-market APIs feed raw DuckDB tables; v0.1.x ships Polymarket
  Gamma and CLOB ingestion.
- Dagster coordinates market discovery, registry refresh, odds sync, and dbt.
- dbt models staging, intermediate, mart, and observability schemas.
- Operator scripts inspect, compact, prune, and repair local warehouse state.

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) and [Warehouse](docs/warehouse.md).

## Data Outputs

Current Polymarket analytics outputs live in `polymarket_marts`:

- `token_coverage`: token-level coverage and health.
- `market_coverage`: market-level daily coverage rollup.
- `wc2026_token_minutely_odds`: full WC2026 minutely odds time series.
- `wc2026_token_daily_odds`: full WC2026 daily OHLC odds time series.
- `wc2026_markets`: scoped WC2026 market universe.
- `wc2026_whale_minutely_odds`: high-volume WC2026 minutely odds.

See [Data Contracts](docs/data-contracts.md).

## Development

```bash
uv run make lint
uv run make test
uv run make integration-dagster
uv run make integration-dbt
uv run make coverage
uv run make docs-check
uv run make dbt-parse
uv run make dbt-build-ci
uv run make costguard
```

`dbt-build-ci` uses a disposable DuckDB database under `.cache/` for CI parity.
Costguard is a dbt/CI guardrail, not an odds ingestion runtime dependency.
Install the pinned local scanner with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hypertrial/costguard/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- v2.5.0
```
