# Overview

**oddsfox** is a self-hosted, MIT-licensed FOSS data lake creator for prediction-market research.
v0.2.0 builds a local Polymarket and Kalshi lake end-to-end: fetch, normalize, catalog, compute, query, and serve.

It answers six research questions locally:

1. What markets exist?
2. What were their probabilities over time?
3. How liquid were they?
4. How did they resolve?
5. How accurate/calibrated were they?
6. What is a user-supplied account's PnL on Polymarket, Kalshi, and combined?

## Non-goals

- Trading, signing, wallets
- Hosted data mirrors
- Order submission, wallet custody, or hosted user-specific exchange data
- On-chain archive reconstruction

## Success demo

```bash
oddsfox quickstart
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8787>. `quickstart` keeps serving until you stop it.
