# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking

- Removed ignored `--db` flags from `quickstart` and `serve`. Use `oddsfox duckdb` / `oddsfox sql --db` for catalog paths; `serve` reads Parquet directly.
- Incremental reads now ignore run-partitioned bronze data unless its manifest run is marked complete; `repair` quarantines orphan run partitions instead of trying a network resync.

### Changed

- Sync and backfill progress lines (`sync markets complete`, `sync prices progress`, Kalshi price sync) now include RFC3339 UTC timestamps, matching `collect hourly` output.
- `collect hourly` now fetches price history in 7-day API chunks (Polymarket `interval=max`) instead of one call per UTC hour per token; hourly parquet layout and cursor keys are unchanged.
- Added `collect hourly --active` to collect only tokens from markets where `active = true`.
- Added `collect hourly` for durable UTC-hour price collection across Polymarket and Kalshi with per-token resume cursors.
- `quickstart` now starts the local read-only UI after building the demo lake.
- `sql` now prints tab-separated multi-column output with headers and a configurable `--limit`.
- README and CLI docs now lead with quickstart and release installer usage for analyst onboarding.
- Price sync resume now uses per-token range/fidelity checkpoints instead of file existence alone.
- Raw JSON captures are written through temp files and atomically renamed into place.
